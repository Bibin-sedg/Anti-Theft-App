# Anti-Theft-App
   The increasing use of mobile phones in our daily lives has made them an essential part of our existence, and losing one can be a frustrating and sometimes devastating experience. The risk of losing our mobile phones has become more significant than ever before, with thefts and robberies on the rise. By taking this as reason I have developed my **final year project(Anti-Theft-Android-App)** using Java.

***This android project has advanced features like:***

  * If the phone is lost user can track down the device by tracking funtionality.
  * If someone tries to power off the device, it will prevent it from accessing power off button.
  * As well As it will prevent other from accessing drop down menu. Due to this turing off data connection or turning on airplane mode from drop down menu is impossible.
  * Though the mobile data is in off, We can get the current location of the device by sending SMS "locate Phone" so the automatically reply with it's current location.
